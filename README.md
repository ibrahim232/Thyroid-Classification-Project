# Thyroid-Classification-Project
# Thyroid Disease Prediction

## Background of the Data

The Thyroid Disease dataset comprises data on 3,772 patients collected from two medical centers in Germany. It focuses on individuals diagnosed with thyroid disease and includes a range of information such as demographic details, thyroid hormone levels, and diagnostic data. The primary goal is to predict the presence and type of thyroid disease in a patient.

## Problem Statement

The objective is to develop a classification model that can accurately predict the type of thyroid disease (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or euthyroidism) a person has, based on various features.

## Dataset Features

The dataset contains the following attributes:

- **Age** (Numeric): Age of the patient.
- **Sex** (Categorical): Sex of the patient (M or F).
- **On_thyroxine** (Categorical): Indicates if the patient is on thyroxine treatment (f or t).
- **Query_on_thyroxine** (Categorical): Indicates if the patient has queries about thyroxine treatment (f or t).
- **On_antithyroid_medication** (Categorical): Indicates if the patient is on antithyroid medication (f or t).
- (Additional features follow the same structure)
- **TBG** (Numeric): Level of thyroxine-binding globulin in the patient's blood.

## Methodology

### 1. Importing Libraries

Essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, preprocessing, and modeling are imported at the beginning.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This section details the steps taken to clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values and converting data types.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Describes the analysis performed to understand the data better, including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.

### 4. Data Encoding and Scaling

Explains how categorical variables were encoded and numerical features scaled to prepare the data for modeling.

### 5. Data Modeling

Describes the process of building the classification model, including the selection of model types, training process, and any hyperparameter tuning conducted.

### 6. Model Evaluation

Presents the methods used to evaluate the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and discusses the results.

### 7. Deployment

Briefly outlines how the model can be deployed in a production environment or what steps would be needed to make the model ready for deployment.

## Conclusion

Summarizes the findings of the project, the effectiveness of the model, and any potential improvements or future work that could be done to enhance the model's performance.
