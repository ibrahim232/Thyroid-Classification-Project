# Thyroid Disease Prediction

## Background of the Data
The Thyroid Disease dataset consists of information on 3,772 patients from two medical centers in Germany. It targets individuals diagnosed with thyroid disease, encompassing a variety of details such as demographic data, thyroid hormone levels, and diagnostic information. The main objective is to forecast the presence and type of thyroid disease in a patient.

## Problem Statement
The aim is to develop a classification model that accurately predicts the type of thyroid disease (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or euthyroidism) a person has, based on a range of features.

## Dataset Features
The dataset includes the following attributes:

- **Age** (Numeric): Age of the patient.
- **Sex** (Categorical): Sex of the patient (M or F).
- **On_thyroxine** (Categorical): Indicates if the patient is on thyroxine treatment (f or t).
- **Query_on_thyroxine** (Categorical): Indicates if the patient has queries about thyroxine treatment (f or t).
- **On_antithyroid_medication** (Categorical): Indicates if the patient is on antithyroid medication (f or t).
- (Additional features continue in the same structure)
- **TBG** (Numeric): Level of thyroxine-binding globulin in the patient's blood.

## Methodology

### 1. Importing Libraries
Initial step involves importing essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, preprocessing, and modeling.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
This step covers cleaning and preprocessing the dataset for analysis, which includes handling missing values and converting data types.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this phase, the data is analyzed to gain a better understanding through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.

### 4. Data Encoding and Scaling
This process involves encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.

### 5. Data Modeling
Describes building the classification model, including selecting model types, the training process, and any hyperparameter tuning that was conducted.

### 6. Model Evaluation
Details the methods used to evaluate the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and discusses the outcomes.

### 7. Deployment
Outlines how the model can be deployed in a production environment or the steps needed to prepare the model for deployment.

## Conclusion
Summarizes the project's findings, the effectiveness of the model, and potential improvements or future work to enhance the model's performance.
